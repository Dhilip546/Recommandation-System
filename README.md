# The project involves creating a recommendation system for an online retail store. Using machine learning algorithms, it analyzes customer purchase data to suggest personalized items. By building a model that learns from past behavior, the system generates recommendations tailored to individual preferences. Evaluation metrics ensure the model's accuracy, and a user-friendly interface allows customers to access recommendations based on their unique profiles. Ultimately, the project showcases the effectiveness of recommendation systems in enhancing user experiences and driving sales in e-commerce platforms.
